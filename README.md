# PingPong2D🏓
Welcome to 2D Ping Pong, a simple yet addictive game🕹️ that will test your reflexes and hand🖐️-eye👁️ coordination. The objective of the game🎮 is to hit the ball⚽ back and forth across the screen and score points by making the ball⚽ hit the opposing player's side of the screen.

## How to Play
Use the W, A, S, and D keys for the left side player and the arow keys for the right side player to move the paddle.
If you hit the ball while moving towards it, it will go faster🐇 and if you hit it while moving away from it, it will go slower🐌.
The first player to reach 11 points while having 2 more pints than other player wins the game.

Enjoy the game and have fun!
